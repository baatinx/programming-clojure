1. All Clojure functions implement Callable and Runnable

2. Symbols are names that refer to things

3. vectors are sequential, indexed collections. Lists are sequential collections stored as a linked list.
   Sets are unordered collections.Sets are a good choice when you want fast addition and removal of elements 
   and the ability to quickly check for whether a set contains a value.
   Clojure maps are collections of key/value pairs, Like sets, maps are also unordered 

4. If you see the phrase “foo changes x,” mentally substitute “foo returns a changed copy of x.”

5. Whenever a structure-specific function like subvec duplicates functionality already available in the sequence library,
   it’s probably there for performance
